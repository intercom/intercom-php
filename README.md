[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/537da4a7e30ba062b101be9c/badges/2aa25d4736f09f40282e/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/repos/537da4a7e30ba062b101be9c/feed) [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/intercom/intercom-php.png?style=badge)](https://circleci.com/gh/intercom/intercom-php)

Official PHP bindings to the Intercom API

## Installation

This library supports PHP 7.1 and later

This library uses [HTTPlug](https://github.com/php-http/httplug) as HTTP client. HTTPlug is an abstraction that allows this library to support many different HTTP Clients. Therefore, you need to provide it with an adapter for the HTTP library you prefer. You can find all the available adapters [in Packagist](https://packagist.org/providers/php-http/client-implementation). This documentation assumes you use the Guzzle6 Client, but you can replace it with any adapter that you prefer.

The recommended way to install intercom-php is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```sh
composer require intercom/intercom-php php-http/guzzle6-adapter
```

## Clients

Initialize your client using your access token:

```php
use Intercom\IntercomClient;

$client = new IntercomClient('<insert_token_here>');
```

> If you already have an access token you can find it [here](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/_/developer-hub). If you want to create or learn more about access tokens then you can find more info [here](https://developers.intercom.com/building-apps/docs/authorization#section-access-tokens).
>
> If you are building a third party application you can get your OAuth token by [setting-up-oauth](https://developers.intercom.com/building-apps/docs/authorization#section-oauth) for Intercom.

For most use cases the code snippet above should suffice. However, if needed, you can customize the Intercom client as follows:

```php
use Intercom\IntercomClient;

$client = new IntercomClient('<insert_token_here>', null, ['Custom-Header' => 'value']);

$client->setHttpClient($myCustomHttpClient); // $myCustomHttpClient implements Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface
$client->setRequestFactory($myCustomRequestFactory); // $myCustomRequestFactory implements Http\Message\RequestFactory
$client->setUriFactory($myCustomUriFactory); // $myCustomUriFactory implements Http\Message\UriFactory
```
## API Versions

This library is intended to work with any API Version. By default, the version that you have configured for your App in the [Developer Hub](https://developers.intercom.com/) will be used. However, you can overwrite that version for a single request or for all the requests using this library by including the `Intercom-Version` header when initializing the client as follows:

```php
$client = new IntercomClient('<insert_token_here>', null, ['Intercom-Version' => '1.1']);
```

For more information about API Versioning, please check the [API Versioning Documentation](https://developers.intercom.com/building-apps/docs/api-versioning) and the [API changelog](https://developers.intercom.com/building-apps/docs/api-changelog).

## Contacts

```php
/** Create a contact */
$client->contacts->create([

## Rate Limits

Rate limit info is passed via the rate limit headers.
You can access this information as follows:

```php
$rate_limit = $intercom->getRateLimitDetails();
print("{$rate_limit['remaining']} {$rate_limit['limit']} \n");
print_r($rate_limit['reset_at']->format(DateTime::ISO8601));
```

For more info on rate limits and these headers please see the [API reference docs](https://developers.intercom.com/reference#rate-limiting)

## Pagination

When listing, the Intercom API may return a pagination object:

```json
{
  "pages": {
    "next": "..."
  }
}
```

You can grab the next page of results using the client:

```php
$client->nextPage($response->pages);
```

In API version 2.0 subsequent pages for listing contacts can be retreived with:

```php
$client->nextCursor($response->pages);
```

## Scroll

The first time you use the scroll API you can just send a simple GET request.
This will return up to 100 records. If you have more than 100 you will need to make another call.
To do this you need to use to scroll_parameter returned in the original response.
Use this for subsequent responses until you get an empty array of records.
This means there are no records and the scroll timer will be reset.
For more information on scroll please see the [API reference](https://developers.intercom.com/reference#iterating-over-all-users)
Here is an example of a simple way to use the scroll for multiple calls:

```php
require "vendor/autoload.php";

use Intercom\IntercomClient;

$intercom = new IntercomClient(getenv('AT'), null);
$resp = $intercom->users->scrollUsers([]);
$count = 1;
echo "PAGE $count: " . sizeof($resp->users);
echo "\n";
while (!empty($resp->scroll_param) && sizeof($resp->users) > 0) {
    $count = ++$count;
    $resp = $intercom->users->scrollUsers(["scroll_param" => $resp->scroll_param]);
    echo "PAGE $count: " . sizeof($resp->users);
    echo "\n";
}
```

## Exceptions

Exceptions are handled by HTTPlug. Every exception thrown implements `Http\Client\Exception`. See the [http client exceptions](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/httplug/exceptions.html) and the [client and server errors](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/plugins/error.html).
The Intercom API may return an unsuccessful HTTP response, for example when a resource is not found (404).
If you want to catch errors you can wrap your API call into a try/catch block:

```php
try {
    $user = $client->users->getUser("570680a8a1bcbca8a90001b9");
} catch(Http\Client\Exception $e) {
    if ($e->getCode() == '404') {
        // Handle 404 error
        return;
    } else {
        throw $e;
    }
}
```

## Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour**. Make sure the README and any other
  relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Create topic branches**. Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature**. If you want to do more than one thing, send
  multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history**. Make sure each individual commit in your pull
  request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while
